# NextJS

## What is NextJS?

-   The react framework for production
-   Used to build large scale react applications production ready
-   A full stack react framework
-   Solves common problems and makes building React apps easier!
-   Doesn't require as many third party libraries to make an app
-   You still write react code, components, props, state, context etc...
-   lots of built-in features (e.g. routing) that help you solve common problems & clear guidance on how to use those features

## Server Side Rendering

-   prepares the content on the page on the server instead of the client
-   helps search engine crawlers find content on your page to send to searchers
    -   on client side rendering search engine crawlers only see the html skeleton
-   better user experience because there is no flicker
-   automatic page pre-rendering
    -   great for SEO and inital load
-   blends client-side and server-side
    -   fetch data on the server and render finished pages

## KEY FEATURES

    -   define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code
    -   less code, less work, highly understandable
    -   lets you go back to a more basic html type routing
    -   supports dynamic routes, slugs etc...
-   fullstack framework
    -   easily add backend server-side code to your next/react apps
    -   stores data, getting data, authentication etc. can be added to your react projects
