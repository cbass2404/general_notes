# NextJS

## What is NextJS?
- The react framework for production
- Used to build large scale react applications production ready
- A full stack react framework
- Solves common problems and makes building React apps easier!
- Doesn't require as many third party libraries to make an app
- You still write react code, components, props, state, context etc...
- lots of built-in features (e.g. routing) that help you solve common problems & clear guidance on how to use those features

## Server Side Rendering
- prepares the content on the page on the server instead of the client
- helps search engine crawlers find content on your page to send to searchers
    - on client side rendering search engine crawlers only see the html skeleton
- better user experience because there is no flicker
-
